# How to use sharpmonoinjector
After you have your dll file, you'll need to have a way to inject it into the game. There are 2 option Command line or with a batch file.
### Command line
1. Once you have sharpmonoinjector downloaded from [here](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector/releases/download/v2.2/SharpMonoInjector.Console.zip), extract the zip.

2. Next open a command prompt window as administrator and type the command:

`cd [path to folder with smi.exe in it]` 

obviously replacing "[path to folder with smi.exe in it]" with the proper path. For example my command is:

`cd C:\Users\Kamron Cole\Documents\My Cheats\RoR2\SharpMonoInjector.Console\SharpMonoInjector.Console`

3. You can tell if you're in the proper directory if you type `dir` and you see SharpMonoInjector.dll and smi.exe listed

4. Once you are in the proper directory and Risk of Rain 2 is open, type 

`smi.exe inject -p "Risk of Rain 2" -a "[Path to RoRCheats.dll]" -n RoRCheats -c Loader -m Load` 

again replacing [Path to RoRCheats.dll] with the proper path (keep the quotes)

### Batch file
1. Once you have sharpmonoinjector downloaded from [here](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector/releases/download/v2.2/SharpMonoInjector.Console.zip), extract the zip.
2. Right click on your Desktop -> New -> Text Document
3. Open the text document and paste the following
```
@echo off
cd "[path to folder with smi.exe]"
cls
smi.exe inject -p "Risk of Rain 2" -a "[Path to RoR2Cheats.dll]" -n RoRCheats -c Loader -m Load
pause
```
4. Replace [path to folder with smi.exe] and [Path to RoR2Cheats.dll] with the proper paths (keep quotes if they are there)
5. Press ctrl+shift+s and name it `start.bat` (make sure you replace .txt with .bat)
6. If everything was done properly, while the game is open just run `start.bat` as administrator and the Menu should automatically be injected into the game
